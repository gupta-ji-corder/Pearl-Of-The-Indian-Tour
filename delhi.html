            <h3>Qutub Minar</h3>
            <span class="desc">Tucked within the historic folds of Delhi’s Mehrauli area, Qutub Minar once stood as a towering symbol of the early Delhi Sultanate’s architectural legacy. The grandeur of this minaret and the intricacy of its stone carvings have made it one of the most striking and visited tourist attractions in India.
                Qutub Minar is situated close to several other monuments of the Qutub Complex and is entirely surrounded by lush gardens and age-old ruins that whisper stories of India’s medieval past.
                Crowning itself as one of the tallest brick minarets in the world, Qutub Minar attracts both history buffs and architecture enthusiasts for a wide range of experiences.
                The Iron Pillar, Alai Darwaza, Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, and the unfinished Alai Minar are some key highlights within the Qutub Complex.
                In recognition of its cultural and historical importance, Qutub Minar was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993.

            <h3>Humayun's Tomb,</h3>
            <span class="desc">Humayun’s Tomb is a grand architectural marvel built in 1570 by Empress Bega Begum, the wife of the Mughal Emperor Humayun. This impressive mausoleum, situated in the heart of Delhi, is often referred to as the precursor to the Taj Mahal for its magnificent Persian-style domes and symmetrical gardens. Sprawling over a vast complex of around 27 hectares, the tomb is surrounded by lush green lawns and a classic Charbagh-style garden, making it one of the most serene retreats in the bustling city.

            The tomb itself is built on a raised platform and crowned with a magnificent double dome, showcasing intricate red sandstone and white marble work. At its core lies the central chamber housing the emperor’s cenotaph, while smaller chambers around it hold the graves of several other Mughal royals. The site is also dotted with pavilions, water channels, and walkways that offer visitors peaceful spots to sit, relax, and admire the artistry of the Mughal era.
            Tourists and history enthusiasts often stroll along the garden pathways, especially in the morning or evening when the weather is pleasant, and the setting sun casts a golden hue on the sandstone structure. The complex is particularly captivating at dusk, as the tomb glows softly under the fading light. Photography lovers and architecture buffs find themselves drawn to its balance, symmetry, and ornamentation.</span>
